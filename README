Editing

Visiting a file with extension ".c0" or ".h0" will switch to C0 mode,
which is derive from C mode.  This provides syntax highlighting,
matching parentheses, and indentation.  The latter is particularly
useful and invoked simply with the <tab> key while the cursor is on a
line of code.  I routinely hit <return><tab> at the end of a line.
It's not perfect, but very helpful
